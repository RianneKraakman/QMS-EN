[["app-criticalZvalues.html", "B Standard normal probability distribution", " B Standard normal probability distribution The critical value \\(Z^*\\) given below has a probability of \\(p\\) under \\(H_0\\), i.e., \\(P(Z &gt; Z^*|H_0)=p\\) (the blue area), and it has a probability of \\(B\\) to have a value in the interval \\((-Z^*, +Z^*)\\) (the yellow area). The \\(Z\\) distribution is symmetrical around \\(Z=0\\), hence \\(P(Z &lt; -Z^*) = P(Z &gt; Z^*)\\).
