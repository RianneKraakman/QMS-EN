The availability of large amounts of digital data (such as text, speech, video, behavioural measurements) raises new research questions, which are typically and often investigated using quantitative methods. Aimed at humanities researchers and students, this book offers an overview of and introduction into the most important quantitative methods and statistical techniques used in the humanities. The book provides a solid methodological foundation for quantitative research, and it introduces the most commonly used statistical techniques to describe data and to test hypotheses. This will also enable the reader to critically evaluate such quantitative research. This textbook is being used in the course on Methods and Statistics 1 at Utrecht University (Linguistics program). The book is also highly suitable for self-study at a basic level, for everybody who wishes to learn more about quantitative methods and statistics. The main text has been kept free of mathematical derivations and formulas, which are typically not very helpful for humanities scholars and students. Our explanation is rather conceptual, and rich in examples. Where necessary we present derivations and formulas in separate sections. This book also contains instructions on how to “do” the statistical analyses and visualisations, both in SPSS (version 22 or later) and in R (version 3.0 or later). These instructions too are in separate sections. We would like to thank our co-teachers in various courses for the many discussions and examples that have been used in any shape or form in this textbook. We thank our students for their curiosity and for their sharp eyes in spotting errors and inconsistencies in previous versions. We are also thankful to Gerrit Bloothooft, Margot van den Berg, Willemijn Heeren, Caspar van Lissa, Els Rose, Tobias Quené, Kirsten Schutter and Marijn Struiksma, for their advice, data, comments and suggestions. We thank Aleksei Nazarov and Joanna Wall for translating this book from Dutch to English.
